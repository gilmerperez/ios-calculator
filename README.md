# iOS Calculator

## Project Summary

This is a fully functional, mobile-responsive calculator built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to replicate the interface and behavior of Apple’s iOS 18 Calculator. It provides a clean, intuitive user experience with dynamic input handling and responsive design.

The calculator supports basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) along with special functions like clear (AC), percentage, and sign toggle (±). A dual-display system shows the full expression during input and the result after evaluation, mimicking iPhone Calculator logic.

The project emphasizes DOM manipulation, event handling, semantic HTML, and modern CSS practices—including variables, media queries, and grid layouts. It promotes maintainable, accessible code and serves as a strong foundation for expanding into advanced UI logic or React-based applications.
